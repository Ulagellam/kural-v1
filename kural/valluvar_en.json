	"p1":"Valluvar must have written the Kural sometime between the 2nd century B.C. to 8th century A.D. Though the most commonly stated period is 2nd century A.D.,the Tamils in Tamil Nadu have traditionally considered 31 B.C. as the year of his birth as accepted by the Tamil Academy of Madurai.",
	"p2":"According to some scholars, however, he lived and wrote during Post Sangam Period (300 A.D. to 600 A.D.). Rarely do scholars place Valluvar and his work in the 7th or 8th century AD. The work is considered anterior to the two Tamil epics of 2nd to 5th century A.D. namely Manimekhalai and Silappadikaram as they clearly contain few references to Valluvar's couplets in them. ",
	"p3":"It appears that the author of Thirukkural would have lived sometime between the 2nd and 4th centuries A.D."
